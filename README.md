# lab4-itsp
This repository defines many geometry classes and allows you to run a unit test on all the functions from these classes

## Purpose

Inside *lab4* you may find many class definitions of different geometries. Those are **Point**, **Rectangle**, **Circle** and **Shape**. The *Test.py* script is meant to pass a unit test to all the functions from these classes. It is important to mention that all classes inherit the Shape Class.  

## Usage

To run the unit test open your terminal and run the Test.py script as follows in the *lab4* directory:

```
$ python Test.py -v
```

You should receive a message like

```
Ran 32 tests in 0.001s
```
